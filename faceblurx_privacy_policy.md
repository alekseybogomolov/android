Privacy Policy for FaceBlurX

Effective Date: October 26, 2025

aicompas001@gmail.com ("I", "me", "my") built the FaceBlurX app (the "App") as an Ad-supported app. This App is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

I respect your privacy. This page is used to inform users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information if anyone decides to use the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

1. Information Collection and Use
Information You Provide (Photos)

The core functionality of the App is to process your photos to detect and blur faces (or apply other effects).

All photo processing, including face detection (via ML Kit) and blur effects (via RenderScript), is performed entirely on your device. Your photos, images, and any resulting edits are never uploaded to any server, shared, or collected by me. They remain on your device unless you choose to save or share them yourself.

Personally Identifiable Information

The App does not collect, use, or store any of your personal and confidential information, such as your first name, last name, email address, or phone number.

Automatically Collected Information (Third-Party Services)

The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. This information is typically non-personal and is used for serving advertisements and managing user privacy consent (like GDPR).

The App uses the following third-party services:

Google Play Services: A set of services from Google that are essential for app functionality.

Google AdMob: Used to display advertisements in the App. AdMob may collect device information, IP address, and advertising identifiers (like Google's Advertising ID) to serve personalized ads.

Google User Messaging Platform (UMP): Used to request and manage user consent for data collection, as required by privacy regulations like GDPR.

Firebase Analytics: Used to collect anonymous usage statistics (e.g., which features are used most) to help improve the App. This service does not collect personal information.

Firebase Crashlytics: Used to automatically collect reports on app crashes and errors. This helps me identify and fix bugs to improve the App's stability.

Google ML Kit: Used for the on-device face detection feature. This service processes photo data locally on your device and does not send your images to Google.

2. Permissions
The App requests the following permissions to work properly:

Internet: Required to load and display advertisements from Google AdMob and to manage your privacy consent via Google's UMP.

Storage (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE): This permission is only requested on devices running Android 9 (Pie) or older. It is required to save your edited images to your device's gallery. On newer Android versions, this permission is not needed as the App uses the modern MediaStore API.

3. Children's Privacy
This App is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete this from any records. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary actions.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
